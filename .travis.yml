# Builds can unfortunately time out, either during installation of dependencies 
# or during the build itself, for instance because of a command that’s 
# taking a longer amount of time to run while not producing any output. 

# When a long running command or compile step regularly takes longer 
# than 10 minutes without producing any output, you can adjust your build 
# configuration

# use travis_wait, a function that’s exported by our build environmen
# prefix the command with travis_wait n where n is the number of minutes 

# run test scripts
script: 
    # extend timeout to 30 minutes
    travis_wait 30 pytest --disable-warnings -r A --maxfail=10
